for every number in the list. obtain it's counterparts left, right, up, down
check if it's higher than any counterparts. if it is, then skip to next one and don't store in list

treat these all like strings

for(var x = 0; x < strings.length; x++) {
for(var y = 0; y < string.length; y++) {


//iterating through each number now
var thisnum = strings[x]string[y];
left would be strings[x]string[y-1];
right would be strinfgs[x]string[y+1];
up would be strings[x-1]string[y];
down would be strings[x+1]string[y];
